# Multi-Feature Web Application

A full-stack application that combines web scraping, AI-powered text generation, and video processing capabilities. This project demonstrates advanced web technologies including Playwright for scraping, Gemini AI for intelligent content generation, and FFmpeg for video manipulation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automated data extraction using Playwright
- **AI Text Generation**: Intelligent content creation powered by Gemini AI
- **Video Processing**: Advanced video generation and manipulation using FFmpeg.js
- **Full-Stack Architecture**: React frontend with Node.js backend

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Internet connection for AI API calls

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-name>
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
PORT=3001
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBF0tgIuZuzksjwRqdSfLf5O8wSHi-SF68
GEMINI_API_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

### Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
# or for development with hot reload
npm run dev
```
Backend will run on: `http://localhost:3001`

### Start Frontend Application
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```
Frontend will run on: `http://localhost:3000`

### Quick Start (Both Services)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend && npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend && npm start
```
